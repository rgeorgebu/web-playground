# Web Playground

A collection of HTML/CSS/JS experiments used to improve my own mental model of
how things work and what is possible with web technologies.

## Getting Started

Start a web server rooted at one of the top level directories (or just serve
the raw `index.html`).

```bash
npx serve -s $TOP_LEVEL_DIRECTORY
```
